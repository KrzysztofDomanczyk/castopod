# Castopod

Castopod is an open-source podcast hosting solution for everyone. Whether you
are a beginner, an amateur or a professional, you will get everything you need:
create, upload, publish, manage server subscriptions (WebSub embedded server),
connect to the usual directories (Apple, Google, Spotify…), connect to the
Fediverse (ActivityPub, Mastodon, Pleroma…) and measure your audience (IAB 2.0
compliant) so that you can monetize your content. Take back control: interact
with your audience on your plateform (like, share, comment), the social network
IS the podcast. Of course you may also export to proprietary social
networks(Twitter, Instagram, Youtube, Facebook). Castopod can be hosted on any
PHP/MySQL server: Unzip it and you and other podcasters are ready to broadcast
professionally.

## Free

Castopod is a free and open-source solution (AGPL v3). Whether you choose to
install it on your own server or have it hosted by a professional, all your data
and analytics belong to you and you only.

## Social Media

Castopod is a part of Fediverse (Mastodon, Pleroma, PixelFed, PeerTube…).
Podcasters and their audience can post, subscribe, like, comment and share
natively. Millions of users already on Fediverse will be able to interact
seamlessly.

## Flexible

Castopod is compatible with all Podcasts players and platforms (it can
automatically generate an RSS feed). Moreover Podcasters can choose to publish
on Castopod while keeping their existing hosting solution (it can automatically
generate posts from an existing RSS feed).
