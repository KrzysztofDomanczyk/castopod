## Introduction

Castopod is a web app based on the `php` framework
[CodeIgniter 4](https://codeigniter.com).

To setup a dev environment, we use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). A
`docker-compose.yml` and `Dockerfile` are included in the project's root folder
to help you kickstart your contribution.

> Know that you don't need any prior knowledge of Docker to follow the next
> steps. However, if you wish to use your own environment, feel free to do so!

## Prerequisites

0. Install [docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

1. Clone castopod project by running:

```bash
git clone https://code.podlibre.org/podlibre/castopod.git
```

2. Create a `.env` file with the minimum required config to connect the app to
   the database and use redis as a cache handler:

```ini
CI_ENVIRONMENT="development"

app.baseURL="http://localhost:8080/"
app.mediaBaseURL="http://localhost:8080/"

app.adminGateway="cp-admin"
app.authGateway="cp-auth"

database.default.hostname="mariadb"
database.default.database="castopod"
database.default.username="podlibre"
database.default.password="castopod"

cache.handler="redis"
cache.redis.host = "redis"

# You may not want to use redis as your cache handler
# Comment/remove the two lines above and uncomment
# the next line for file caching.
#cache.handler="file"
```

> _NB._ You can tweak your environment by setting more environment variables in
> your custom `.env` file. See the `env` for examples or the
> [CodeIgniter4 User Guide](https://codeigniter.com/user_guide/index.html) for
> more info.

3. Add the repository you've cloned to docker desktop's `Settings` >
   `Resources` > `File Sharing`.
4. Install castopod's php dependencies

> The project's php dependencies aren't included in the repository, you have to
> download them using the composer service defined in `docker-compose.yml`

```bash
docker-compose run --rm composer install --ignore-platform-reqs
```

5. Install castopod's js dependencies

> The project's js dependencies aren't included in the repository, you have to
> download them using the node service defined in `docker-compose.yml`

```bash
docker-compose run --rm node npm install
```

6. Build assets: javascript, styles, icons and svg images

> To generate public assets, you must run the following commands.

```bash
docker-compose run --rm node npm run build:js
docker-compose run --rm node npm run build:css
docker-compose run --rm node npm run build:icons
docker-compose run --rm node npm run build:svg
docker-compose run --rm node npm run copy:images
docker-compose run --rm node npm run copy:fonts
```

## Start docker containers

Go to project's root folder and run:

```bash
# starts all services declared in docker-compose.yml file
# -d option starts the containers in the background
docker-compose up -d

# See all running processes (you should see 3 processes running)
docker-compose ps

# Alternatively, you can check all docker processes (you should see composer and npm with an Exited status)
docker ps -a

```

> The `docker-compose up -d` command will boot 4 containers in the background:
>
> - `castopod_app`: a php based container with CodeIgniter4 requirements
>   installed
> - `castopod_redis`: a [redis](https://redis.io/) database to handle queries
>   and pages caching
> - `castopod_mariadb`: a [mariadb](https://mariadb.org/) server for persistent
>   data
> - `castopod_phpmyadmin`: a phpmyadmin server to visualize the mariadb
>   database.

## Initialize and populate database

1. Build the database with the migrate command:

```bash
# loads the database schema during first migration
docker-compose run --rm app php spark migrate -all
```

In case you need to roll back, use this command:

```
# rolls back database schema loading (deletes all tables and their content)
docker-compose run --rm app php spark migrate:rollback
```

2. Populate the database with the required data:

```bash
# Populates all required data
docker-compose run --rm app php spark db:seed AppSeeder
```

You may also add only data you chose:

```bash
# Populates all categories
docker-compose run --rm app php spark db:seed CategorySeeder
# Populates all Languages
docker-compose run --rm app php spark db:seed LanguageSeeder
# Populates all podcasts platforms
docker-compose run --rm app php spark db:seed PlatformSeeder
# Populates all Authentication data (roles definitionâ€¦)
docker-compose run --rm app php spark db:seed AuthSeeder
```

3. (optionnal) Populate the database with test data:

```bash
# Populates test data (login: admin / password: AGUehL3P)
docker-compose run --rm app php spark db:seed TestSeeder
# Populates with fake podcast analytics
docker-compose run --rm app php spark db:seed FakePodcastsAnalyticsSeeder
# Populates with fake website analytics
docker-compose run --rm app php spark db:seed FakeWebsiteAnalyticsSeeder
```

TestSeeder will add an active superadmin user with the following credentials:

- username: **admin**
- password: **AGUehL3P**

## Install/Update app dependencies

Castopod uses `composer` to manage php dependencies and `npm` to manage
javascript dependencies.

You can install / update the project's dependencies using both `composer` and
`node` services:

```bash
# install php dependencies
docker-compose run --rm composer install --ignore-platform-reqs

# update php dependencies
docker-compose run --rm composer update --ignore-platform-reqs
```

> _NB._ composer commands look for the `composer.json` file to find castopod's
> php dependencies, all of which live in the `vendor/` folder. For more info,
> check out [Composer documentation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/).

```bash
# install js dependencies
docker-compose run --rm node npm install

# update js dependencies
docker-compose run --rm node npm update
```

> _NB._ npm commands look for the `package.json` file to find castopod's js
> dependencies, all of which live in the `node_modules/` folder. For more info,
> check out [NPM documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/).

## Start hacking

You're all set! Start working your magic by updating the project's files! Help
yourself to the
[CodeIgniter4 User Guide](https://codeigniter.com/user_guide/index.html) for
more insights.

To see your changes, go to:

- [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) for the castopod app
- [localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888/) for the phpmyadmin interface:

  - username: **podlibre**
  - password: **castopod**

## Going Further

### Useful docker / docker-compose commands

```bash
# monitor the app container
docker-compose logs --tail 50 --follow --timestamps app

# interact with redis server using included redis-cli command
docker exec -it castopod_redis redis-cli

# monitor the redis container
docker-compose logs --tail 50 --follow --timestamps redis

# monitor the mariadb container
docker-compose logs --tail 50 --follow --timestamps mariadb

# monitor the phpmyadmin container
docker-compose logs --tail 50 --follow --timestamps phpmyadmin

# restart docker containers
docker-compose restart

# Destroy all containers, opposite of `up` command
docker-compose down

# Rebuild app container
docker-compose build app
```

Check [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/docker/) and
[docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/) documentations for
more insights.

## Developing inside a Container

If you're working in VSCode, you can take advantage of the `./.devcontainer/`
folder. It defines a development container with preinstalled VSCode extensions
so you don't have to worry about them. The container will be loaded with php,
composer and git:

1. Install the VSCode extension
   [Remote - Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
2. `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P` > `Open in container`

The VSCode window will reload inside the dev container.

You can check that the required packages are running in the console
(`Terminal` > `New Terminal`):

```bash
php -v

composer -V

git version
```

For more info, see
[VSCode Remote Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers)

## Known issues

- `Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory` when running `npm install`

  ðŸ‘‰ By default, docker might not have access to enough RAM. Allocate more
  memory and run `npm install` again.
